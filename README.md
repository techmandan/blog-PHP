## blog-PHP
### Blog-php is simple and lightweight blogging software with bootstrap styles.

Config is made by text so no more _install.php_ => just upload _SQL file to your database_ and **full-fill** the names.php and you can make your first blog post.


## Config
### Configuration is easy as on other software, the only bad thing is the reality that it has no graphics.
Configuration is made as easy as it can be.
There's no need to do a one-hour setup, just edit the file and you are all-set.
# Installation
### Composer
You can install easy be pasting<br/>
`composer require danielbulant/blog-php`<br/>
to install by composer.
### Other
You can also install by downloading from GitHub and just un-zip it to folder where you want the blog to live.
Just don't forget to edit `names.php` for text on the pages, else the blog will don't work(because there's also settings that are REQUIRED by blog, like SQL).
