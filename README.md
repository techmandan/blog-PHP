## blog-PHP
### Blog-php is simple and lightweight blogging software with bootstrap styles.

>  **THE PROJECT IS OUTDATED! PLEASE USE `MY BLOG`, WHICH WILL BE
> AVAIBLE SOON**

Config is made by text so no more `install.php` => just upload _SQL file to your database_ and **full-fill** the `names.php` and you can make your first blog post.

## Config
### Configuration is easy as on other software, the only bad thing is the reality that it has no graphic settings.
Configuration is made as easy as it can be.
There's no need to do a one-hour setup, just edit the file and you are all-set.

**Just don't forget to edit** `names.php` for text on the pages, else the blog will don't work(because there's also settings that are **REQUIRED** by blog, like SQL).
